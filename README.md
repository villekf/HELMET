# HELMET

High-dimensional Kalman filter toolbox (HELMET) is an open-source software for high-dimensional dynamic problems. HELMET includes various KF algorithms that can be used to estimate any linear dynamic problems.

# Introduction

HELMET is a software for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/) and [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) to estimate especially high-dimensional dynamic problems. However, the software does not have constraints on the input data size or dimensionality, the only requirement is a linear problem.
